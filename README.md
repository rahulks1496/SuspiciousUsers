Finding Suspicious Users on Social Media
This report elucidates the work done on social media data, in this case Twitter data to find suspicious users on the social network. Many users look at social network as a platform to perform various illegal activities like spreading various illegal messages or for cyber bullying. It is very important to take action against this and stop such activists. This requires an analysis technique which will classify these users as suspicious. This project implements an approach based on a multi-language model to find suspicious users on social media. The software built downloads user tweets from twitter servers and then three different text analysis techniques namely Bag of Words, N Grams and Gamma N words are implemented on this data. A dictionary of suspicious words is created based on which the text analysis is done. The three techniques mentioned give individual results which are then combined to give a final list of suspicious users.
